### To run the application I reccomend starting a virtual environment (python -m venv ./venv)
### Afterwards, activate the venv with the activate file in the bin subdirectory of venv
* on Mac you do `source ./venv/bin/activate`

### Now install python 3.10, on mac I ran `brew install python@3.10`
### Finally, download the dependencies with `python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
